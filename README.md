SM_NOMS
===============
Sourcemod Plugin that provides a way to list currently nominated maps for the next vote

INSTALLATION:
-------------
Simply compile with the command 

> ./compile.sh noms.sp

and move the compiled .smx file to your `"<modname>/addons/sourcemod/plugins"`
directory.

Also make sure you have the mapchooser.smx, nominations.smx (and optionally rockthevote.smx) stock plugins enabled on your server otherwise this plugin won't be of much use


USAGE:
------
When on a server with mapchooser enabled simply type into chat:

> `!noms`

A list of nominated maps will appear in chat.
